INTRODUCTION                                          *vroom* *vroom-introduction*

Vroom is an “EasyMotion” like plugin allowing you to jump anywhere in a
document with as few keystrokes as possible. It does so by annotating text in
your buffer with |hints|, short string sequences for which each character
represents a key to type to jump to the annotated text. Most of the time,
those sequences’ lengths will be between 1 to 3 characters, making every jump
target in your document reachable in a few keystrokes.

Vroom is a complete from-scratch rewrite of EasyMotion, a famous plugin to
enhance the native motions of Vim. Even though EasyMotion is usable in
Neovim, it suffers from a few drawbacks making it not comfortable to use with
Neovim version >0.5 – at least at the time of writing these lines:

- EasyMotion uses an old trick to annotate jump targets by saving the
  contents of the buffer, replacing it with the highlighted annotations and
  then restoring the initial buffer after jump. This trick is dangerous as it
  will change the contents of your buffer. A UI plugin should never do anything
  to existing buffers’ contents.
- Because the contents of buffers will temporarily change, other parts of the
  editor and/or plugins relying on buffer change events will react and will go
  mad. An example is the internal LSP client implementation of Neovim >0.5 or
  its treesitter native implementation. For LSP, it means that the connected
  LSP server will receive a buffer with the jump target annotations… not
  ideal.

==============================================================================
REQUIREMENTS                                                *vroom-requirements*

Vroom works only with Neovim and was written Neovim-0.5, so it is highly
recommended to use Neovim version 0.5+.

==============================================================================
LIMITATIONS AND KNOWN ISSUES                          *vroom-limitations-issues*

Vroom currently has difficulties to correctly set the hints if you are using
'conceallevel', 'concealcursor' or any kind of features related to |conceal|.
Most of the time, the hints will be slightly offset but jumping to them will
place your cursor at the right place.

Vroom has big issues with 'wrap'. It is recommended to disable 'wrap' for the
time being. A fix will land to make it work as soon as possible.

Emojis are also a topic of big annoyance. They will make Vroom behave the same
way it does with |conceal| — i.e. somehow broken right now.

==============================================================================
USAGE                                                              *vroom-usage*

Commands~
                                                                *vroom-commands*
You can try those commands by typing them in your command line.

                                                                    *:VroomWord*
:VroomWord
    Annotate all words in the current window with key sequences. Typing a
    first  key will visually filter the sequences and reduce them. Continue
    typing key sequences until you reduce a sequence completely, which will
    bring your cursor at that position.

    This is akin to calling the |vroom.jump_words| Lua function.

Lua API~
                                                                 *vroom-lua-api*
The Lua API comprises several modules:

`vroom`           Entry point and main interface. If you just want to use
                Vroom from within Lua via keybindings, you shouldn’t need to
                read any other modules.
`vroom.defaults`  Default options.
`vroom.hint`      Various functions to create, update and reduce hints.
`vroom.keymap`    Implementation of the keymap allowing to perform jumps.
`vroom.perm`      Permutation functions. Permutations are used as labels for
                the hints.

Main API~

Most of the functions and values you need to know about are in `vroom`.

`vroom.jump_words(`{opts}`)`                                      *vroom.jump_words*
    Annotate all words in the current window with key sequences. Typing a
    first key will visually filter the sequences and reduce them. Continue
    typing key sequences until you reduce a sequence completely, which will
    bring your cursor at that position. See |vroom-lua-opts| for a complete list
    of the options you can pass as arguments.

`vroom.refine_hints(`{buf_handle}`,` {key}`)`                     *vroom.refine_hints*
    Refine hints in buffer {buf_handle} by reducing sequences starting with
    {key}. If a sequence has only one key remaining and that key is {key},
    the associated hint jump target is triggered.

    If {key} is not found as the first key in any sequence currently visible,
    the function will abort and report an error to the user stating that no
    remaining sequence starts with {key}.

Hint API~

The hint API allows to create, reduce and display *hints* in easy ways.

`vroom.hint.by_word_start`                              *vroom.hint.by_word_start*
    |word| hint mode. This mode will highlights the beginnings of all the
    words in the document and will make the cursor jump to the one fully
    reduced.

`vroom.hint.mark_hints_line(`                         *vroom.hint.mark_hints_line*
  {hint_mode}`,`
  {line_nr}`,`
  {line}
`)`
    Mark the given {line} with hints according to the input {hint_mode}. The
    {line_nr} must be the row where the {line} comes from.

    This function returns all the hints for {line} as a table consisting of
    three information:
>
        { line, col, real_col }
<
    `line` is the same as {line_nr} and is simply forwarded. `col` is the
    column at which the hint visually starts. `real_col` is the column at
    which the hint starts taking into account multi-byte characters.

    Use `col` for displaying the hints and `real_col` to jump to it.

    The returned hint is to be considered as a placeholder, as it doesn’t have
    its hint label yet. Have a look at |vroom.hint.create_hints| for further
    information about how the `hint` field is added.

`vroom.hint.reduce_hint(`{hint}`,` {key}`)`                   *vroom.hint.reduce_hint*
    Reduce {hint} with {key}.

    If {hint} didn’t start with {key}, it is returned as-is. If {hint} started
    with {key}, that {key} is removed from its beginning. If the remaining
    hint is empty, `nil` is returned, otherwise the reduction is returned.

`vroom.hint.reduce_hints_lines(`                   *vroom.hint.reduce_hints_lines*
  {per_line_hints}`,`
  {key}
`)`
    Reduce all hints in {per_line_hints} and return the fully reduced one, if
    any.

    If a hint is fully reduced, its `hint` field will be `nil` but its `line`,
    `col` and `real_col` fields can still be used to jump to it.

`vroom.hint.create_hints(`                               *vroom.hint.create_hints*
  {hint_mode}`,`
  {buf_heigth}`,`
  {cursor_pos}`,`
  {lines}`,`
  {opts}
`)`
    Given a set of {lines}, this function creates the hints for each line in
    {lines} by respecting the {hint_mode}. The {cursor_pos} is used to alter
    the sequence distribution over the buffer.

    The returned value is a table containing the following fields:
>
        { line, col, real_col, hint }
<
    The meaning of `line`, `col` and `real_col` is the same as with
    |vroom.hint.mark_hints_line|. `hint` contains the permutation making the
    sequence that can be displayed and typed by a user to jump to.

`vroom.hint.create_buffer_lines(`                 *vroom.hint.create_buffer_lines*
  {buf_width}`,`
  {buf_height}`,`
  {per_line_hints}
`)`
    Create the lines that can be put in a buffer to show the hints. The lines
    are created by using an algorithm allowing the hints to be cut if they
    overlap with others. {per_line_hints} should be an object returned by
    |vroom.hint_create_hints|.

    This function returns the content of the buffer as a list of lines, and
    each line is represented with a single string.

Permutation API~

The permutation API is the core part of the algorithm used in Vroom.
Permutations in Vroom are made out of a source sequence of characters, called
a key set and represented with {keys}. A good choice of key set is important
to yield short and concise permutations, allowing to jump to targets with
fewer keystrokes.

`vroom.perm.permutations(`{keys}`,` {n}`,` {opts}`)`           *vroom.perm.permutations*
    Get the first {n} permutations out of {keys}.

    This function will generate shorter permutations first, and when a given
    dimension is fully exhausted, will switch to the next dimension. The first
    permutations will be of dimension 1 (i.e. a single character), taken out
    from {keys}. Once all keys are exhausted for 1-character permutations, the
    next permutations will be generated for dimension 2 (i.e. two characters),
    also taken out from {keys}.

    {keys} is split into two sets: terminal keys are keys that, when press,
    immediately trigger a jump. They can be found in the 1-character
    permutations and at the end of longer sequences, but never in the at the
    beginning nor the middle of a longer permutations. Sequence keys represent
    the second set and can never be found in 1-character permutations, nor in
    terminal positions of longer ones.

    For a permutation `perm` which length is greater or equal than 2, any keys
    for which the index in the permutation is between `1` and `#perm - 1` are
    sequence keys and the last key in the permutation at index `#perm` is a
    terminal key.

Keymap API~

The keymap API allows to create buffer-local bindings to be able to jump to
hints targets. Those keymaps are automatically inserted when you call
functions such as |vroom.jump_words|. They are made out of the {keys} in your
{opts}.

`vroom.keymap.create_jump_keymap(`               *vroom.keymap.create_jump_keymap*
  {buf_handle}`,`
  {opts}
`)`
    Create the dynamic keymap in the buffer referred to by {buf_handle} by
    mapping all the keys found in {opts}.{keys}.

    If {opts} is `nil` or if {opts}.{keys} is `nil`, the appropriate {keys}
    value will be taken out from |vroom.defaults.opts|.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                                     *vroom-config*

`keys`                                                         *vroom-config-keys*
    A string representing all the keys that can be part of a sequence. Every
    character (key) used in the string will be used as part of a sequence. The
    shortest sequence is a sequence of a single character, and depending on
    the content of your buffer, you might end up with 3-character sequences in
    worst situations.

    However, it is important to notice that if you decide to provide `keys`,
    you have to ensure to use enough characters in the string, otherwise you
    might get very long sequences and a not so pleasant experience.

    Defaults:
>
        keys = 'asdghklqwertyuiopzxcvbnmfj'
<
`reverse_distribution`                        *vroom-config-reverse_distribution*
    The default behavior for key sequence distribution in your buffer is to
    concentrate shorter sequences near the cursor, grouping 1-character
    sequences around. As words get further from the cursor, the dimension of
    the sequences will grow, making the furthest words the longest sequences
    to type.

    Set this option to `true` to reverse the density and concentrate the
    shortest sequences (1-character) around the furthest words and the longest
    sequences around the cursor.

    Defaults:
>
        reverse_distribution = false
<
`term_seq_bias`                                       *vroom-config-term_seq_bias*
    Bias used to alter the proportion of keys used as terminal keys vs. used
    as sequence keys. It is not recommended to tweak around with this value
    too much as it will degrade the experience, but if you really want to give
    it a try, you should set this value to a number representing the ratio of
    terminal keys and sequence keys. A ratio of `3/4`, for instance, means
    that for 12 keys, 9 will be used as terminal keys and 3 will be used as
    sequence keys.

    Defaults:
>
        term_seq_bias = 3 / 4
<
`winblend`                                                 *vroom-config-winblend*
    'winblend' value to use for the hint buffer.

    Remember that setting a fully opaque hint buffer will make it impossible
    to see where you are jumping.

    Defaults:
>
        winblend = 50
<
`teasing`                                                   *vroom-config-teasing*
    Boolean value stating whether Vroom should tease you when you do something
    you are not supposed to.

    If you find this setting annoying, feel free to turn it to `false`.

    Defaults:
>
        teasing = true
<
